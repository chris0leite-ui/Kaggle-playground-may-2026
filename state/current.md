# Where we are right now

Single source of truth for the current PRIMARY, LB ladder, axes
status, and submission count. **Rewrite this file when PRIMARY
changes** — do not tail-append. Prior versions live in
`audit/archive-YYYY-MM-DD-current-md-*.md`.

**Date convention:** ISO dates ("2026-05-14") or comp-day-N anchored
to comp start 2026-05-01. The `d13`..`d19` labels in script names
and old audit prose are FROZEN code prefixes — never calendar days
(per `glossary.md` and the `day-counter-drift` friction).

## PRIMARY (active) — set 2026-05-19 Round 14

**LB 0.95395** — R14 K=16 (K=13 + cb_horizon + cb_stint_completion + TabM) + Path-B DriverClass × Stint τ=100k.

K=16 pool = K=13 pool (yekenot, cb_v4, hgbc_deep, d16_orig, qAT, qAV,
qAO, qAA, qAF, qAK, K27_100k, seg_fe, HMM) + **cb_horizon** (CB
regression on `log(LapsUntilPit+1)` strict per-fold) + **cb_stint_completion**
(CB regression on `TyreLife / stint_max` strict per-fold) + **TabM**
(pytabkit `TabM_D_Classifier`, NN-class diversity, full 5-fold on
Kaggle T4×2, ~79 min wall). Path-B DriverClass × Stint segmentation
unchanged from R7.

File: `submissions/submission_R14_K16_tabm_pathb_dcs_tau100000.csv`.
OOF 0.954487 (+0.0193 bp over R13 0.954485); LB 0.95395 (+0.02 bp
over R13 0.95393; **+0.06 bp cumulative over R7.1 0.95389** in one
session via four PRIMARY swaps R7.1 → R12-2 → R13 → R14).
Submission ref 52807696.

Round-14 finding: TabM (NN-class structural diversity) stacks with
two orthogonal-target CatBoosts. TabM base ρ_OOF vs R13 = 0.926 —
much more orthogonal than cb_horizon (0.626) — and its standalone
0.93856 is competitive with mid-tier K=13 bases. The +0.019 bp OOF
sub-gate prediction registered +0.02 bp LB; OK-band edge ρ_test
0.99991 (just below TIE_ZONE 0.9999) was MORE forgiving on LB than
the predicted-noise-floor estimate. Calibration confirms the +0.02
bp floor is correctly placed: borderline candidates near the floor
DO register on LB.

## Prior PRIMARY R13 (2026-05-19 Round 13) — retained for hedge

**LB 0.95393** — K=15 (K=13 + cb_horizon + cb_stint_completion) + Path-B DCS τ=100k.
File: `submissions/submission_R13_K15_cbh_cbsc_pathb_dcs_tau100000.csv`.
OOF 0.954485. Hedge: "remove TabM" ablation.

## Prior PRIMARY R12-2 (2026-05-19 Round 12-2) — retained for hedge

**LB 0.95392** — K=14 (K=13 + cb_horizon) + Path-B DCS τ=100k.
File: `submissions/submission_R12_cb_horizon_K14_pathb_dcs_tau100000.csv`.
OOF 0.954475. Hedge: "remove cb_stint_completion AND TabM" ablation.

## Prior PRIMARY R7.1 (2026-05-18 Round 7) — retained for hedge

**LB 0.95389** — K=13 + Path-B DriverClass × Stint τ=100k.
File: `submissions/submission_K13_pathb_driverclass_stint_tau100000.csv`.
OOF 0.954471. Hedge: "remove all 3 extra bases" pure-K=13 baseline.

## Prior PRIMARY R5.2 (2026-05-18 Round 5) — retained for hedge

**LB 0.95387** — K=13 + Path-B Compound × Stint τ=100k.
File: `submissions/submission_K13_seghmm_pathb_tau100000.csv`.

## Hedge candidate R7.2 (2026-05-18 Round 7)

**LB 0.95389** (ties R7.1) — R7.1 + 5-seed fold-fit bag.
File: `submissions/submission_K13_dcs_pathb_foldbag.csv`. OOF 0.95450
(+0.264 bp over R7.1 single-seed; largest OOF lift of session).
Structurally distinct hedge for private-LB variance.

## Pre-Round-5 PRIMARY (2026-05-12) — retained for hedge ladder

**LB 0.95386** (rank-blend 70/30 of two LB-confirmed submissions).

- **Constituent A (70%)**: K=11 + K=27 + Path-B τ=100k. LB 0.95385.
- **Constituent B (30%)**: K=9 qAX (qAT+qAV+qAO+qAA+qAF + Path-B
  τ=20k). LB 0.95375.

File: `submissions/submission_blend_K11_K9_w_70_30.csv`.

The cross-mechanism blend cancels small errors: K=11 uses K=27
super-base + slim-kNN; K=9 uses slim-kNN only. PI-authorised
override of Rule 27 abort threshold (ρ_test ≥ 0.999) yielded the
+0.1 bp lift despite ρ = 0.9998 — uncorrelated-error cancellation
at the 5-decimal Kaggle quantisation.

## Today's status (2026-05-19)

- Submissions used this comp: **47 / 270**. Daily cap: 10.
- Today (2026-05-19): **1 used**, 9 unused. PI directive: spend slots
  ONLY on a mechanism G2-clear (Δ ≥ +0.10 bp OOF vs R7.1 PRIMARY);
  forfeit unspent slots at Kaggle UTC midnight.
  - **R10 HEDGE 3: 75/25 arith blend (R7.2 5-seed bag + K=27 wide-pool) → LB 0.95387** (-0.02 bp vs PRIMARY 0.95389). True .npy ρ=0.999882 (OK band) registered as -0.02 bp LB delta. First cross-mechanism diversity hedge confirmed; HEDGE-3 slot in final-window ladder filled.
  - R10 blend-operator sweep over {R7.1, R7.2, R5.2, R6.1, K27} × {arith, gmean, logit_mean, rank_mean}: only OK-band (ρ <0.9999) candidate was the R7.2+K27 75/25 arith blend submitted above. All others TIE_ZONE.
  - R10 multi-constituent LR-meta alt-stack (LambdaRank stint + race + rolling LGBM + kernel hazard, 4 constituents): blended w/ R7.1 returned Δ < 0 at every weight (best Δ=-0.045 bp). **Closes alt-stack as 4th rank-lock axis.** See `audit/2026-05-19-round-10-hedge-prep.md`.
  - **R11-C survival/hazard model (Cox-PH at TyreLife as base)**: standalone OOF **0.64971** G1-FAIL (covariates per-stint; row-level differentiation collapses onto h₀(t)). K=14+Path-B DriverClass×Stint τ=100k: OOF **0.954466**, Δ vs R7.1 PRIMARY (0.954471) = **−0.0487 bp NULL**, ρ_OOF=0.99992 TIE_ZONE. Closes mechanism C in same shape as R9 NB4 (−0.022) and R9 C1 (−0.045). Per-stint Cox PH absorbed by Path-B. `audit/2026-05-19-round-11-survival.json`.
  - **R11-A (transformer)**: DROPPED. R5/R6 transformers already CLOSED per HANDOVER line 134 (R5 v1 0.91974 absorbed; R6 v2 K=14+Path-B Δ=−0.014 bp absorbed). Multi-step head variant is a marginal twist not a structural pivot. PI directive: redirect T4 budget to B.
  - **R11-B (transverse cross-driver attention transformer)** — Kaggle T4×2 kernel ran 34s. Standalone OOF **0.62085** G1-FAIL; K=14+Path-B DCS τ=100k Δ vs R7.1 PRIMARY **−0.0346 bp NULL**, ρ_OOF 0.99992 TIE_ZONE. **Bug + structural finding:** MAX_DRIVERS=24 truncated 80% of groups (synthetic data has 887 unique pseudo-drivers; per-(Year, Race, LapNumber) group has median 58 / mean 71 / max 373 drivers vs ~22 real F1). Even at MAX_DRIVERS=128 the inter-driver-competition cohort signal we wanted is dissolved by the synthetic augmentation. Cross-driver-attention mechanism CLOSED at this formulation. `kernels/r11-graph-transverse-gpu/`, `audit/2026-05-19-round-11-B-K14-add.log`.
  - **R11 swing summary**: 3 of 3 R10-queue mechanism-expansion candidates closed in one session (A skipped via dedup; B NULL via data structure; C NULL via inductive-bias collapse). Same null shape as R9 NB4 (−0.022) / R9 C1 (−0.045). Rank-lock at K=13+Path-B now confirmed across FIVE axes (operator / mechanism / data / alt-stack / cross-class learned-mech). PRIMARY R7.1 unchanged at LB 0.95389.
  - Public-notebook rescan (Rule 22; 10 days stale) **DONE**. ONE structurally-novel candidate surfaced: **TabM (pytabkit Tabular Mixture)** — mikhailnaumov's LB-0.95438 kernel is the source behind the entire 0.95449-0.95452 public-LB blender chain. Leader's 0.95476 not reachable from any public mechanism. Queued for next session. `audit/research/2026-05-19-notebooks.md`.
  - **R12 CatBoost-specialist swing** (PI directive "every FE / Optuna / whatever; think hard"; plan-agent reframed as orthogonality-first):
    - **R12-1 cb_resid** (CatBoost regression on residual y − OOF_R7.1, RMSE loss). Standalone OOF AUC **0.47835 BELOW RANDOM** — per-fold ES fires at iter 1-15 because val RMSE does not improve from epoch 0. K=14+Path-B DCS τ=100k Δ vs R7.1 = **−0.0701 bp NULL**, ρ_OOF=0.99995. **STRONG EMPIRICAL BAYES-CEILING CONFIRMATION**: R7.1+Path-B is at the Bayes-optimal calibration ceiling for predicting PitNextLap given the row covariates. Residual prediction probes are CLOSED — any mechanism trying to predict the leftover of a saturated meta will produce sub-random AUC. `audit/2026-05-19-round-12-cb_resid.{log,json}`.
    - **R12-2 cb_horizon (CatBoost on log(LapsUntilPit+1), STRICT per-fold target)**: standalone OOF AUC **0.88137**; **base ρ vs R7.1 = 0.626, vs cb_v4 = 0.607** (genuinely orthogonal direction — multi-step future info that K=13's single-step predictors lack); K=14+Path-B DCS τ=100k OOF **0.954475**, Δ vs R7.1 PRIMARY **+0.0460 bp POSITIVE** (first positive K=14 add since R7.1 set 2026-05-18). ρ_test .npy 0.99983 = OK transfer band. **SUBMITTED** ref 52802828 → **LB 0.95392 = NEW PRIMARY (+0.03 bp over R7.1 0.95389)**. Plan-agent's orthogonality-first thesis paid off on the second variant. Strict per-fold target avoided the documented Day-15 leakage pattern (88-100% OOF collapse).
    - R12-3 cb_mono (monotone constraints on tyre-end-of-life features) DROPPED — same target as K=13, Bayes-ceiling finding makes G2-clear odds ~0.05.
    - R12-4 cb_v5_xl kitchen-sink FE + 30-trial Optuna parking lot — PARKED for future session.
- Submissions used this comp: **48 / 270**. Today (2026-05-19): **2 used** (R10 HEDGE 3 + R12-2 cb_horizon K=14), 8 unspent.
- Kaggle CLI auth fix (session-start blocker): KGAT_-prefixed access tokens must be exported as `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN`, NOT placed in `kaggle.json`'s `key` field (legacy HTTP Basic). Working invocation: `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN="$KaggleAPIToke" kaggle ...`.

## Transfer bands (Rule 27 recalibration, 2026-05-14)

Encoded in `scripts/probe_blend_harness.py::RULE_27_*_THRESHOLD`:

| Band | ρ_test vs PRIMARY | Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| TIE_ZONE | ≥ 0.9999 | LB ties within ±0.05 bp |
| OK transfer | 0.999 ≤ ρ < 0.9999 | Sub-bp to few-bp LB movement |
| REGRESSION_RISK | < 0.999 | Wide-ρ adds overfit CV patterns |

## Strategic conclusion (2026-05-14)

K=11 + LR-meta + Path-B is **at or near the Bayes-optimal ceiling**
for row-feature prediction on this synthetic dataset. The synth
generator decouples PitStop and PitNextLap with a stochastic
component (~20% label disagreement on observable pairs), revealing
a noise floor that no row-level model can recover (audit:
`audit/2026-05-14-overnight-iteration.md`).

Pivots that remain untried:
1. NEW-INFORMATION mechanisms (cross-domain training, FastF1
   hard-join, multi-seed bagging of the full pipeline).
2. Bayesian group-prior with smoothing for sequence-conditional
   error cancellation.
3. Different blend operators (geometric mean, log-odds mean) over
   the 4 LB-confirmed PRIMARYs (cost 5 min total).

## Held submissions — DO NOT SUBMIT

Day-17 strict fold-safe audit collapsed all target-reformulation

## Hedge ladder (R5 / R7 final-window candidates)

These don't beat PRIMARY but are eligible for the final-3-day
hedge probe:

- K=4 + Path-B C×S τ=100k (LB 0.95351) — clean reference base.
- K=9 qAX + Path-B τ=20k (LB 0.95375) — slim-kNN solo.
- K=27 + Path-B τ=100k (LB 0.95368) — pre-sparse-pool PRIMARY.
- `d15b_path_b_K22_dae_only_tau{20k,100k}` — Day-15 PRIMARY runner-up.
- `path_b_K5_rf_yekenot_tau{5k,20k,100k}` — Forest-base τ-sweep;
  τ=100k is balanced flips, τ=5k/20k asymmetric (R7 override risk).

## Closed axes (high-level — see mechanism-ledger.md for detail)

- **Stacking pool growth** (A): closed. Rank-lock pool-size-independent.
- **Anchor swap** (B): closed. RealMLP n_ens=24 the only untested
  variant; sqrt(n_ens) bounds ≤1 bp EV.
- **Meta-architecture redesign** (C): closed. 11+ Path-B variants,
  all within ±0.5 bp of plain LR-meta on the current pool.
- **External data** (D): closed per PI direction.
- **Sequence / structural inductive bias** (A1): closed. LambdaRank
  per-stint, inter-stint memory, stint-completion dual-head all NULL
  at K=10+1 despite ρ 0.41–0.73.
- **Non-LR meta architecture** (E): closed (FALSIFIED). LightGBM /
  MLP / RF metas all regress vs LR-meta. Predictive eff-rank ≈ 15,
  variance eff-rank = 3.23 (A25/A30b/A30c).
- **Forest family**: characterised end-to-end. +0.25 bp K=4+1 ceiling
  set by meta architecture, not RF; Path-B absorbs to +0.02 bp.

## What axes remain open

1. **MECHANISM EXPANSION beyond row-feature ceiling** (R9 forced
   pivot 2026-05-18). R9 closed BOTH residual row-feature axes:
   NB4 TE-as-base (−0.022 bp NULL) and C1 external Aadigupta scalars
   (−0.045 bp NULL). Rank-lock at K=13+Path-B is structurally
   confirmed across operator / mechanism / data-class. Three
   structurally orthogonal candidates remain (none tested):
   1. **A1 seq2seq transformer** on per-(Driver, Race) lap
      sequences (HMM K=13 base was BW one-shot on 4 states; full
      attention-LSTM untried). ~2 hr Kaggle T4.
   2. **Graph mechanism** (Race, Lap) per-row graph with competitor
      edges; LightGCN / GAT 2-layer. ~3 hr local CPU or Kaggle T4.
   3. **Survival** Cox PH on stint-life as hazard-base. ~30 min CPU.
2. **Blend operator sweep** — arithmetic / geometric / log-odds /
   trimmed mean over 4 LB-confirmed PRIMARYs. Cost 5 min.
3. **R7d hedge ladder finalisation** (final-window posture, days
   28-31 = May 28-31). Ladder candidate set documented above.
4. **NEW-INFO mechanism via cross-domain pretrain** (still on the
   2026-05-14 list, but FastF1 hard-join capped at 1.4% match;
   C1 falsified the simpler per-Race scalar variant of this axis).
